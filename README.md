# companion-module-sennheiser-evolutionwireless

Allows you to control and monitor Sennheiser Wireless Units supporting
Sennheisers [Media control Protocol](https://assets.sennheiser.com/global-downloads/file/12478/TI_1254_MetroMediensteuerung_ewG4_EN.pdf) (
mainly ew 300-500 G4 and ew IEM G4)

This module was tested and written for the ew IEM G4, however shared commands between them should also work on ew
300-500 G4.
Adding more features for ew 300-500 G4 (or any other receiver supporting the protocol) should be easy, however currently
not implemented.
