# companion-module-sennheiser-evolutionwireless

Allows you to control and monitor Sennheiser Wireless Units supporting Sennheisers [Media Control Protocol](https://assets.sennheiser.com/global-downloads/file/12478/TI_1254_MetroMediensteuerung_ewG4_EN.pdf) (mainly ew 300-500 G4 and ew IEM G4)

This module was tested and written for the ew IEM G4, however shared commands between them should also work on ew 300-500 G4.
Adding more features for ew 300-500 G4 (or any other receiver supporting the protocol) should be easy, however currently not implemented.
